  "about": "<div class=\"about-content\"><h2>Super Battleship</h2><p class=\"subtitle\">Classic Battleship Expanded</p><h3>Enhanced Gameplay</h3><p>Super Battleship takes the classic game to the next level with a larger 12x12 board, additional ships, and strategic terrain. Navigate around islands and through shoal waters as you command an expanded fleet with enhanced munitions.</p><h3>Fleet Composition</h3><p>Your fleet includes the standard Carrier, Battleship, Submarine, and Destroyer, plus an additional Cruiser and Destroyer for more tactical options. The larger board provides more room for strategic placement and longer-range engagements.</p><h3>Strategic Terrain</h3><p>Two islands create natural obstacles and strategic chokepoints, while shoal waters along the board edges require careful navigation. Ships that can operate in shallow water gain tactical advantages near the edges.</p><h3>Enhanced Munitions</h3><p>Your submarine carries two torpedoes for devastating underwater attacks, while star shells and scatter shot provide additional tactical options for locating and damaging enemy vessels.</p></div>",
