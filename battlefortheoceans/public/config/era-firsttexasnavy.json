  "about": "<div class=\"about-content\">\n<h2>First Texas Navy</h2>\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The Birth of the Texian Navy (1835-1836)</p>\n\n<h3>The Texas Revolution at Sea</h3>\n\n<p>In January 1836, the provisional government of Texas purchased four schooners to establish the First Texas Navy: Liberty, Independence, Brutus, and Invincible. These vessels, all schooners ranging from 60 to 125 tons, were tasked with protecting the Texas coastline and disrupting Mexican supply lines during the Texas Revolution.</p>\n\n<p>The Texas Navy was supplemented by privateers operating under letters of marque, including the San Felipe, Terrible, and Flash. These privateers played a crucial role in the early naval engagements of the revolution, with the San Felipe engaging the Mexican revenue cutter Correo de México in September 1835—an encounter many consider the opening naval battle of the Texas Revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Facing them was the Mexican Navy, including the schooner Montezuma, the brig Bravo (possibly a rebuilt Montezuma), the brig Vencedor del Alamo, and various sloops and armed schooners. The naval war in the Gulf of Mexico was as critical to Texas independence as the land battles at the Alamo and San Jacinto.</p>\n\n<h3>The Ships of the First Texas Navy</h3>\n\n<h4>Liberty</h4>\n<p>Originally the privateer William Robbins, this 60-ton schooner was purchased in January 1836 and renamed Liberty. Commanded by Captain William S. Brown, she participated in early naval engagements of the Texas Revolution.</p>\n\n<h4>Independence</h4>\n<p>A 125-ton schooner, formerly the U.S. Revenue Cutter Ingham, acquired in January 1836. Under Captain Charles Hawkins, Independence played a significant role, including transporting President David G. Burnet and the captured General Santa Anna to Velasco for the Treaties of Velasco.</p>\n\n<h4>Brutus</h4>\n<p>A 125-ton schooner purchased in January 1836. Commanded by Captain William A. Hurd (who had previously commanded the privateer San Felipe), Brutus participated in blockades of Matagorda and engagements along the Mexican coast.</p>\n\n<h4>Invincible</h4>\n<p>A 125-ton schooner built in Baltimore, Maryland (originally for the African slave trade), acquired in January 1836. Under Captain Jeremiah Brown, Invincible destroyed the Mexican man-of-war Bravo and captured the merchant vessel Pocket, which was supplying the Mexican army.</p>\n\n<h3>Privateers of the Republic</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to the official navy, the Texas government issued letters of marque to privateers. The San Felipe, commanded by William A. Hurd, engaged in the first naval battle of the revolution. The Terrible and Flash also operated under Texas authority, disrupting Mexican shipping and protecting the Texas coast.</p>\n\n<h3>The Mexican Response</h3>\n\n<p>The Mexican Navy deployed several vessels to counter the Texas naval threat, including the schooner Montezuma, the brig Bravo, the brig Vencedor del Alamo, and various sloops and armed schooners. The naval war in the Gulf was fierce, with both sides seeking to control supply lines and protect their coastlines.</p>\n\n<p>Command your fleet. Face the Mexican Navy. And fight for Texas independence on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n</div>",
