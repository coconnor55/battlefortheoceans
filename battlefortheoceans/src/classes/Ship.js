/**
 * v0.2.1: Progressive Fog of War System
 * - Added 'hitCount' tracking for reveal stages
 * - Added getRevealLevel() method (hidden/hit/size-hint/critical/sunk)
 * - Added getSizeCategory() method (small/medium/large)
 * - Added getMaxHealth() method for health percentage calculations
 * - receiveHit() now increments hitCount
 *
 * v0.2.0: Defense Modifier System
 * - Added 'shipClass' parameter to constructor (required)
 * - Added 'class' property for ship classification
 * - Added 'defense' property (damage reduction multiplier)
 * - getDefenseModifier() calculates defense based on ship class:
 *   - Submarine: 0.67 (33% damage reduction - hard to hit due to depth)
 *   - Battleship: 0.83 (17% damage reduction - heavy armor)
 *   - All others: 1.0 (standard - no defense bonus)
 * - Defense works with attack/defense boosts (multiplicative)

class Ship {
    // Ship is a battle unit that has a name, size (1-5 cells), and allowed terrain (could be cannon on land too).  Each cell has health, initially 1.0, and can go negative if receiving a high power (>1.0) shot or a partial shot (e.g. 0.1) followed by a full (1.0) shot.  The ship is sunk when its total health drops to 0. Allowed ships are defined in the era-config file for a game. [FUTURE] A Ship can be captured (random chance) when its health falls to zero.  In this instance, a ship is reset with a random health between 50% and 75% and fires 50% power shots.  This, of course, messes up player maps because the ship disappears after being sunk and then reappears as a new ship.
