const version = "v0.9.4";
// v0.9.4: Added userProfile parameter to constructor
//         - Player now holds reference to lifetime statistics (userProfile)
//         - Per-game stats (hits, misses, etc.) still reset each game
//         - userProfile contains: total_games, total_wins, total_score, best_accuracy, etc.
//         - Simplifies architecture: Player is self-contained with both per-game and lifetime stats
// v0.9.3: Fixed autoPlaceShips to use all four orientations (0/90/180/270)
//         - Was only using 0° and 90°
//         - Now randomly selects from all four directions
// v0.9.2: Changed orientation from string to numeric degrees (0/90/180/270)
//         - 0° = Horizontal L→R (stern left, bow right) - default
//         - 90° = Vertical pointing UP (stern bottom, bow top)
//         - 180° = Horizontal R→L (stern right, bow left)
//         - 270° = Vertical pointing DOWN (stern top, bow bottom)
//         Updated placeShip() to accept degrees (default 0)
//         Updated autoPlaceShips() to use 0 or 90 randomly
// v0.9.1: Store ship orientation in shipPlacements for rendering
//         Added orientation parameter to placeShip()
//         Updated autoPlaceShips() to pass orientation
// v0.9.0: Phase 4 Refactor - Renamed missedShots → dontShoot for semantic clarity
//         dontShoot now includes both water misses AND destroyed ship cells
//         Prevents player from clicking invalid targets (miss or destroyed)
// v0.8.0: Phase 3 Refactor - Player now owns fleet reference
//         Added setFleet(), getShip(), isDefeated() methods
//         Player is self-contained entity with board, fleet, and placements
// v0.7.0: Phase 2 Refactor - autoPlaceShips() now writes to this.shipPlacements (dual-write)
//         Still calls game.registerShipPlacement() for Board.cellContents (removed in Phase 4)
// v0.6.1: Phase 1 Refactor - moved autoPlaceShips() from Game.js into Player class
//         Encapsulates placement logic with the player who owns the ships
// v0.6.0: Phase 1 Refactor - added shipPlacements Map for player-owned ship locations
//         Added helper methods: setBoard, placeShip, removeShipAt, getShipAt, etc.
//         Non-breaking addition - existing Board.cellContents still used alongside
