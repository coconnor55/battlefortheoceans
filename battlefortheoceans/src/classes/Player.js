// v0.9.0: Phase 4 Refactor - Renamed missedShots â†’ dontShoot for semantic clarity
//         dontShoot now includes both water misses AND destroyed ship cells
//         Prevents player from clicking invalid targets (miss or destroyed)
// v0.8.0: Phase 3 Refactor - Player now owns fleet reference
//         Added setFleet(), getShip(), isDefeated() methods
//         Player is self-contained entity with board, fleet, and placements
// v0.7.0: Phase 2 Refactor - autoPlaceShips() now writes to this.shipPlacements (dual-write)
//         Still calls game.registerShipPlacement() for Board.cellContents (removed in Phase 4)
// v0.6.1: Phase 1 Refactor - moved autoPlaceShips() from Game.js into Player class
//         Encapsulates placement logic with the player who owns the ships
// v0.6.0: Phase 1 Refactor - added shipPlacements Map for player-owned ship locations
//         Added helper methods: setBoard, placeShip, removeShipAt, getShipAt, etc.
//         Non-breaking addition - existing Board.cellContents still used alongside
