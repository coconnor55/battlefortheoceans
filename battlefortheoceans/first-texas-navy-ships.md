## Notes

- All official Texas Navy ships were schooners
- The Texas provisional government issued letters of marque to privateers in late 1835 and early 1836
- Notable privateers included: San Felipe, Terrible, Thomas Toby (later became Navy ship), Flash, Ocean, and William Robbins (later became Liberty)
- The Thomas Toby was the most successful Texan privateer, capturing several Mexican vessels
- All four original official navy ships (Liberty, Independence, Brutus, Invincible) were acquired in January 1836
- The ships were instrumental in disrupting Mexican supply lines and protecting the Texas coastline during the Texas Revolution
- **Mexican Navy ships**: There is historical uncertainty about the Montezuma/Bravo:
  - Some sources indicate there was one Montezuma (a schooner) that was renamed Bravo
  - Other sources suggest there were two separate vessels: a schooner Montezuma (active 1835) and a brig Montezuma (active 1836, possibly renamed Bravo)
  - The brig Montezuma/Bravo may have been a rebuild of the grounded schooner Montezuma, but this is not definitively documented
  - The vessel destroyed by Invincible in April 1836 is described in some accounts as a brig and in others as a schooner
- Other Mexican Navy ships included Vencedor del Alamo and Correo de México
- The Bravo (or brig Montezuma) was destroyed by the Invincible, and the Vencedor del Alamo retreated from engagement with Texas forces
